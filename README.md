# Move To Folder

This Obsidian plugin automatically moves newly created notes to specific folders based on naming rules you define.

## Features

- Define multiple rules
- Match based on prefix, suffix, or substring
- Automatically create target folders if missing

## Example

If a note name starts with `UA`, move it to `Workspace`.

## Settings

Each rule includes:
- **File name contains** — keyword to match
- **Destination folder** — where to move the note
- **Position** — match at start, middle or end
